# U1.W1: Get to know your cohort

## Learning Competencies
- Describe what you learned from someone else's reflections
- Consider strategies for time management and productivity

## Summary

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. It's important to get used to sharing with each other.

## Releases

## Release 0: Read someone else's reflections

Log on to [Socrates](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/) and look at your cohort. Find the person after you in the cohort list. Click on their name. On their profile, you should see their GitHub username. Go to their repository and read their reflections for each challenge. The URL should be https://github.com/[THEIR-USERNAME]/phase-0-unit-1. If it gives you a 404 error, try writing the URL directly. If you still get an error, send them an email and ask how they are doing.

Once you've read them, or while reading through them, consider what you learned by reading another person's reflections. Keep it in mind for your introduction email!

## Release 1: Intro Email

Each cohort has its own email list visible on the cohort webpage. Email that list with the subject "self-introduction" or reply to the main thread you received. In your email, include your:

- Name
- Location
- Why you're attending DBC
- What you are most excited to learn about
- What you learned by reading [NAME]'s reflection (If the person hasn't completed their reflections, skip this step and send the intro email. Then, when the person does submit their reflections, send an update with what you learned.)
- When the best time for you to pair is
- Links to your 1) forked `phase-0-unit-1` repository and your [USERNAME].github.io site

Send your email!

## Release 2: Check Issues
**DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU HAVE ISSUES ENABLED AS A FEATURE ON BOTH OF YOUR REPOSITORIES**

## Release 3: Review One more
After you start seeing other student's self-introductions, select another person's repository to view (they should have included a link in their email).

Leave feedback for the second person using the "Issues" feature on GitHub. Use the ["How to Create an Issue"](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) instructions for help.

## Release 4: Check in with your accountability group

Accountability groups are designed to give you a core group of people in your cohort to lean on and learn from. You will have a challenge to connect/meet with them each week. As a group you can decide to connect weekly via hangouts, in person, or email. You will also get the chance to work with them on group challenges in later units, so it's important to start building relationships early. You may want to start a code review process within your accountability group as well.

Now that you've introduced yourself to your cohort, it's time to get to know your accountability group. You should have a link to your accountability groups in your Google+ Community. Contact the people in your accountability group via email with the following information:

- Which challenge confused you the most this week
- Which concepts you found most interesting
- The city you currently live in
- Your preferred way of connecting with the group each week (hangout, email, in person, if possible).

## Release 5: Celebrate
You made it through Week 1! How do you feel? Feel free to share your thoughts on twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU1W1** so your cohort mates can easily find your tweets. If you want to tell us how you're feeling, tweet @devbootcamp too.

## Release 6: Submit your work
Don't forget that you need to complete your submission form on <http://apply.devbootcamp.com> to turn in your work and give us feedback! Way to go on making it through the first week!
