## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

A NEW REPO INSTRUCTIONS
: Navigate to your Github repo, click on the "repositories tab", find and click on the "new" button near the top right.
: At the top left, find your user name. To the left of it will be a window. Type "username.github.io", select the "public" button and check the "Initialize this repo...." box. Also click "Add a license:MIT License" button. Then click "Create repository" button.
: On the following page navigate to settings and activate issues.
: Then do the "I'm Awesome" Dance.

OPEN SOURCE: Allowing the world to see the code for a program and letting them not only use it for free but also allowing them to edit it for their own purposes.

MY OPEN SOURCE FEELINGS: It's scary that anyone can use a program as they want to for whatever they want to. It's still the wild west of today and anything could be used for good or bad.

LICENSING: Seems like a way to adjust and assert limits to "Open Source" programing.

CHALLENGES OF THIS CHALLENGE: I actually didn't have much of an issue. It seemed straight forward.

NEW RESOURCES: No new resources..
