Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.

ANSWER: GitHub is a website on the internet that allows people to share files. These files are usually contain the code to a project someone may be working on and wants to share with another programer. Each programer will then download the program into Git. Git is much like GitHub except it only exists on your computer. However, the internet allows a bridge between Git and GitHub. It allows for file transfers. GitHub allows a person to record (leave a breadcrumb trail) points that can be retraced if need be.

Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

ANSWER: Version control is the ability to come back to recorded points and do edits. It can also be thought of as the ability to create multiple copies of a project, distributions of said copies, and retrieval/review/implimentation of the best version of finished project.

Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

ANSWER: It's an efficient way of working on the same project from multiple geographical areas.

What doesn't make sense? What does?

ANSWER: I need practice with pull requests. Not totally familiar with them. Everything else makes sense.



     Forking and cloning Explained
1. Navigate to github.com/devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1
2. Hit the fork button.
3. At the prompt, click on your username.
4. On the new window, find and click the clipboard button.
5. Switch to your terminal screen.
6. cd to dbc stuff folder.
7. type in git clone and the url you copied to clipboard.
8. This will have created a copy of my github-devbootcamp copy to my computer and the remotes(url's) used to retrieve and update from my computer to my github account.

I didn't have too many issues if any at all setting this up. I had done some research before I attempted it. I was confused by the difference of cloning versus git remote add. But I figured it out. It was an "ah-ha!!" moment.
