- Move, rename, and copy items
- Create new and delete existing directories and files
- Open, view, or stream a file
- Find and look inside files
- Get help

## Summary
Programmers do not always have pretty ways to interface or test their code. Most spend a good deal of time in their command line - "a tool where you can use text commands to perform specific tasks." When you use the command line, you don't slow yourself down opening a finder and double-clicking on folders. Instead, you get to navigate around your computer, open, create, delete, move, files, etc. all using commands. It's quick, efficient, and easy once you get the hang of it.

Knowing how to use your command line will be vital to your success as a programmer-- and it's the first place to start getting acclimated to this new way of using your computer.

Unfortunately (or fortunately), the command line is very simple. There are specific commands that will do certain things, so it's easy to learn how to do a lot via the command prompt which should save you some time using your mouse. That said, it's not incredibly fun since using it well requires rote memorization and constant practice.

**Please note: this course suggests a lot of work: making flashcards etc. While you may choose to do that, you might also just prefer to make a cheat sheet for yourself and go through the tutorial in a couple of hours.**

## Releases

## Release 0: Read
Get a bit of information on the command line in the ["What is the Command Line"](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) reading.

Read through this and make a note of anything interesting.

## Release 1: Crash Course
Now go through the [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) to get some practice.

## Release 2: Reflect
Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience.

**Writing reflections for each challenge is mandatory.**

Reflections should be about a paragraph long, and only take you about ten minutes to write.

Please go to the [reflection associated with this challenge](my_reflection.md) to read the prompts and reflect on your learning. You should write the reflection in a separate document. You will add it to GitHub in a later challenge.
