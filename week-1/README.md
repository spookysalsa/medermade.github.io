# Week 1: Git, GitHub, and the Command Line

**Welcome to Phase 0!** We hope you are excited to further your knowledge and begin integrating into the developer and DBC community. Please make sure you've completed the [Phase 0 prerequisites](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/phase-0-prerequisites.md) **before** getting started with the weekly challenges.

Please keep track of how much time you spend on the required sections of Phase 0 challenges. We'll ask you for this information in your weekly submission forms (it's not enough to push your files to GitHub) to gauge whether we are giving too much, the right amount, or not enough work each week.

When you have questions about the instructions or how to do something, are confused, or need help, please post on the Google+ community. Staff and students will post responses. You should never feel alone during Phase 0. Please reach out to us at <phase0@devbootcamp.com> if you do.

We do not expect you to peer-pair during week 1. Most of the challenges are difficult to pair on, so pairing can really start in week 2. That is why we expect you to pair less in Unit 1 than the other units.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU1W1.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 1 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 1)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

## Remember the Unit Expectations!

**NOTE: We do not expect you to peer-pair during week 1. This is here as an FYI. You should still rate at least 7 pieces of feedback.**

Expectation | Times per Unit | Times per Week
------------|----------|---------
[Peer-Pair](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/peer-pairing_sessions.md) | 4 | >= 2
[Give feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) to GPS and peer pairs | 6 | >=2
Rate [feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) | 20 | 7
