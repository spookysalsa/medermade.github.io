# U1.W1: Computer Set-Up Instructions

Now that you know a bit about your command line, you can now get your computer set up for DBC!

Setting up your computer can be tricky, and there are specific technologies we will need you to have in Phases 0, 1, and 2. We've created instructions for installing each of these in Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Please go through these instructions even if you already set up your machine just to check you have everything.

NOTE: These instructions assume you have a "clean" environment and don't have anything funky going on in your system. It should go smoothly if you have a clean system, but it may take significantly more time if you don't have a clean place to start from. Also, some of the commands will change the way your terminal/sublime look, so be prepared for that. You can always change it back. if you would prefer.
