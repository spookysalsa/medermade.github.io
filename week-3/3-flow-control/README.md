#U1.W3: Flow Control

## Learning Competencies
- Compare two objects
- Use conditionals (if, elsif, and else)

## Summary
Up to this point, you've had some pretty basic programs. You put something in; it spits something out. Now is your time to train your computer how to "think." You will be able to tell it to do something if something is true, and something different if something is false. This is called "flow control."

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 7: Flow Control
Read through this chapter. Pine wrote some good exercises here that definitely get a bit more tricky. You can choose to do them as bonus. As you can see, we've also decided to use one of them as well.

## Release 1: Challenges
Now you get to demonstrate your understanding of these concepts by working on some challenges that require flow control. They might take you outside of your comfort zone, and that's ok. You should also feel free to pair on these. Pairing is an awesome way to learn what you know and ask questions about what you don't know yet.

Note: Reference the [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/) (It's easier if you google a class like "Ruby 2.0 string") to find the right documentation. Skim the available methods on the left and then look at the method itself. These are powerful methods that will help you with some of these challenges.

## Release 2: Reflect
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.
