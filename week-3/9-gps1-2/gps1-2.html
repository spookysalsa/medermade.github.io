        <h1>What is Pair Programming?</h1>

            <p>It's collaborating on coding together; Wherein, one person drives and the other navigates. We will explain what the differences between Driver and Navigator. It can also be described as the process of pairing up on a given project with another person so as to devide the duties envolved. This manner of coding creates a space where each person can dedicate their attention and energy on one aspect but with the same purpose in mind. It creates space in a world where a single mind can feel cramped with too much to hold on to.</p></div>

    <div  id = "section2">

        <h1>Why is Pair Programming Important?</h1>

            <p>Because it allows programmers to devide responsibilities between eachother. It allows the driver to focus on the actual process of inputting the code and allows the navigator to focus on how the code will fit and function in the entirity of the program.</p></div>

    <div class = "compare-1">

        <h1>Compare Navigator and Driver?</h1>

           <p>There is a differnce in Driver and Navigator. The Driver takes on the responsibility of typing the code into a document. The Driver should be well aware of the code (language) needed for the type of document. Given that the Driver is well versed in the appropriate code, the Navigator's role is to communicate what will be in the content of the document. At times it is appropriate switch roles.  </p></div>

    <div id="lastp">

        <h1>Last Words!!!</h1>

        <p>We wanted to explain that we had to switch over to sublime text 2 due to malfunctions on stypi.com; Furthermore, Stypi.com didn't render the code properly on a browser. We decided, it was better to have our code work appropriately. With that came a better understanding of what the code was going to do in the real world. Additionally, we've noticed that writing code with a .css document written on the same page as the html code, creates its own difficulties. When creating a paragraph in the text part of the document, the browser will render that paragraph in the position where it was originally typed into. So if you typed it in towards the bottom of the paragraph, it will render towards the bottom of the browser window.
