# Notes for Numbers and Letters

## Numbers

### Summary
- What does `puts` do?

ANSWER: Puts returns nil and print out the output of an equation to the console

- What is the difference between float and integer division?

ANSWER: When you devide with "floats" it means you're using decimals and you anwer will most have a decimal point. Even if the tenth's place is a zero. With integer devision, we don't use numbers with decimals at all.


### Try it!

My solution for:

1.  Hours in a year

```ruby
 irb(main):004:0> puts 24*365
8760
=> nil
```

2. Minutes in a decade

```ruby
irb(main):005:0> puts 8760 * 10 * 60
5256000
=> nil
```
