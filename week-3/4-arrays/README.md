#U1.W3: Arrays, Iterators, and Hashes

## Learning Competencies
- Define and iterate over arrays
- Define and access values in a hash
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
So far you've used variables to store information, but what happens if you have a lot of information to store? Say you want to have a list of your favorite bands, and you are a bit of a music lover so there are hundreds of them. You wouldn't want to have to assign them like so:

```ruby
favorite_band_1 = "Evanescence"
favorite_band_2 = "Nightwish"
favorite_band_3 = "Linkin Park"
```

As you can see, this would take a while. Instead, it would be better to use a different structure to store this information.

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 8: Arrays and Iterators

In this chapter Pine addresses arrays and iterating over arrays.

## Release 1: Challenges
It will be useful for you to look at the [Ruby documentation for arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html). Although the documentation is difficult to read at first, you should start getting as comfortable as possible with these docs. You can also checkout the docs for other objects as well. If you are spending more than an hour on these challenges, you should go back and visit the docs. There are some good simple methods to use to solve these challenges.

- [Find the smallest integer in an array](../exercises/12-smallest-integer)
- [Find the largest integer in an array](../exercises/13-largest-integer)
- [Find the shortest string in an array](../exercises/14-shortest-string)
- [Find the longest string in an array](../exercises/15-longest-string)
- [Concatenate Two Arrays](../exercises/16-concatenate-arrays)
- [Count the numbers in an array between a given range](../exercises/17-count-between)


## Release 2: Hashes
Pine doesn't do justice to hashes in his book, unfortunately, but they are also incredibly important to your understandings of Ruby. You will get many opportunities to work with hashes more in later weeks, definitely try to get a strong conceptual understanding of them. Check out a couple of the following resources to get an introduction:

- Pine's section 12.3
- [Codecademy: Hashes](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-F3loB/0/1?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb) Move to the "Hash" section.
- *The Well-Grounded Rubyist* ch. 9.3

Then complete the following (extremely simple) challenge:
- [Define a Hash](../exercises/18-define-hash)

## Release 3: Reflection
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.
