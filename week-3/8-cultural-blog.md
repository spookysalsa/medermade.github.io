# U1.W3: Cultural Blog: Your Thinking Style and Learning

## Learning Competencies
- Research your thinking style
- Consider strategies for adapting your learning to your thinking style
- Formulate ways to expand the ways you learn and think

## Release 0: Copy your Blog Template
In your [USERNAME].github.io/blog directory, copy your blog template into a new HTML file named `c3_thinking-style.html`. (Note: the number corresponds to the week rather than the actual assignment).

## Release 1: Research

Remember your [Gregorc Thinking Style](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm) from your pre-Phase 0 work? If you can't remember what you are, retake the [personal thinking style](http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html) quiz.

Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.

Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

Now, contemplate the idea of [growth vs. fixed mindset](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/). Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.

## Release 2: Write your Blog
Address the questions above in your blog post.

## Release 3: Publish
Link to your blog on the blog-posts/index.html page of your site and push your changes. Make sure all of your posts so far are linked on the index in order. When you are satisfied, commit and push your changes to GitHub!

## Release 4: Promote
Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohortmates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using **#DBCThinkStyle**.

## Release 5: Read
Read at least one post another student wrote. Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) feedback as an [issue](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md) on their repo or a tweet!
