# U1.W3: Leap Year

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables and methods
- Use conditional statements
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Create a method `leap_year?` that accepts an integer representing a year as input.

It should return `true` if the year input is a leap year and `false` otherwise.

For example,

```ruby
leap_year?(2000) # => true
leap_year?(2001) # => false
```

Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
