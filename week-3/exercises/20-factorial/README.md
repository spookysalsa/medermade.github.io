# U1.W3: Factorial Method

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Iterate over arrays
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Write a `factorial` method which takes as its input a non-negative integer and calculates the factorial of that number.

The factorial of a number is the product of all integers from `1` up to that number.  For example:

```ruby
factorial(5) == 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 == 120
```

The factorial of `0` is defined to be `1`.

You should not use recursion for this problem. Recursion is covered on site. Try it a different way. 

See [the Wikipedia article on the factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) for more information.

Do not use recursion for this method unless you understand recursion already. We don't cover recursion in Phase 0 and there are ways to solve the problem without it. Recursion is a much better topic for when you are on site.

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
