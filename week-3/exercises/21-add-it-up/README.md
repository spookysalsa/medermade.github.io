# U1.W3: Add it up!

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Research and use Ruby methods

## Summary
In this challenge you will write two methods that add elements of an array. In the first, you will be adding numbers and calculating a total. In the second method, you will add strings and make them into a sentence.

Remember to commit early and often!

## Release 0: `total` pseudocode
In this release you must write [pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md) for a method `total` which takes an `Array` of numbers and calculates the sum of all the numbers. (If you don't have a good idea of what pseudocode is, please use the link above to read about it).

The code should work as follows:

```ruby
total([1,2,3])      # => 6
total([4.5, 0, -1]) # => 3.5
total([-100, 100])  # => 0
```

To write pseudocode, first identify the input and output. What will the method receive as an argument (input)? What will be returned (output)? Then outline the steps you'll need to implement to solve the problem using `Array` methods (you can view these in [ruby-docs for arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html)).

## Release 1: Translate Pseudocode into an [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

Translate your pseudocode into code.

## Release 2: Run the tests
Does your code pass the tests for `total` in [array_total_spec.rb](array_total_spec.rb)? Remember to run files by typing:

`rspec array_total_spec.rb`

in the directory where the file is located in your terminal.

If the tests for total pass, move on to the next release. If not, go back and fix the code.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) your solution.

We directed you to use `Array` methods in your first solution, but there are many powerful methods built in to the Enumerable module that can do a lot of that work for you. Navigate to the [ruby-docs for Enumerables](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html). Once you're there, scroll down to see if any of these methods would be useful to do what you want to do. The docs are difficult to read, so start getting practice now.

You should be able to shorten your total method to one line using a specific enumerable method. I'm telling you this to help you look for a specific method, but please don't think all methods should be shortened to one line. Short methods are great as long as the code is readable. By that, I mean that it should be easy to tell what the code is doing simply by scanning it.

Make sure your refactored code passes the tests!

## Release 4: Pseudocode sentence_maker
Now go through the same process for method `sentence_maker`. `sentence_maker` takes an `Array` of strings and returns each element joined into a sentence.

*Note: The first letter should be capitalized and the sentence should end with a period.*

```ruby
sentence_maker(["i", "want", "to", "go", "to", "the", "movies"])
# => "I want to go to the movies."
```

## Release 5: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

Once your solution for `sentence_maker` passes the tests, move on to the next release.

## Release 6: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

Are there any handy methods you can use to shorten the logic in this challenge? See if you can use any of the methods in either Array or Enumerable to help you. Make sure your code is readable!

## Release 8: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
