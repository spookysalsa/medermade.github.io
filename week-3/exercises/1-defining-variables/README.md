# U1.W3: Defining Variables

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables

## Summary
Create variables called `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`.

Assign the variables your personal information.

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Now it's time to make sure your code passes the tests!

In your terminal, make sure you are in this [1-defining-variables](1-defining-variables) directory.

Type `rspec` followed by the file name.

```ruby

$ 1-defining-variables [master] :> rspec my_solution.rb

```

You should get a summary of successes and failures. The failures will have a note to help guide you.

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
