# Week 3: Introduction to Ruby

<!-- Week 3's material is not ready yet!

We will release it with changes at least by the Friday before the week begins. -->

It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase-0-unit-1 master repo to get the newly-released curriculum. Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up! Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) for fetching changes.

You'll want to get a copy of Chris Pine's [*Learn to Program, 2nd edition*](http://www.ebooks-it.net/ebook/learn-to-program-2nd-edition) for this week. You will be reading the content and then completing the challenges we assign.

We are also requiring students to purchase the *Well-Grounded Rubyist* by David A. Black. Please see [this bonus challenge](11-BONUS-challenges/Well-Grounded-Rubyist.md) for a coupon code or you can purchase it on Amazon or other major booksellers (for potentially less than the coupon code). You will also want to invest in [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/) by Sandi Metz, which will be used in week 6.

## Challenges:
You'll see an "exercises" directory. The exercises will be referenced by the challenges below. Please go through the challenges in order.

Before starting, please read Chris Pine's Introduction p. xi - xv.

1. [Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment](1-numbers-letters)
2. [Variables and Methods](2-methods)
3. [Flow Control](3-flow-control)
4. [Arrays, Iterators, and Hashes](4-arrays)
5. [More Methods](5-more-methods)
6. [Fix the Errors](6-fix-the-errors)
7. [Technical Blog](7-technical-blog.md)
8. [Cultural Blog](8-cultural-blog.md)
9. [GPS 1.2](9-gps1-2) **Do not look at this until your guided pairing session!**
10. [Accountability Groups](10-accountability-groups.md)
11. [BONUS Challenges](11-BONUS-challenges) *Optional*

Please note, we put the blog challenges at the end of the week, but you can decide when to work on them. They may be helpful to do in the middle of the week or when you're stuck in another challenge.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU1W3.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 1 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 1)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. You should also try to figure out a fix -- it will help your markdown skills!

## Remember the Unit Expectations!
