# U1.W3: Simple String Methods

## Learning Competencies
- Create local variables
- Apply basic Ruby methods to variables

## Summary
Create a `String` variable called `old_string` and assign it the value `"Ruby is cool"`.

Use `String` methods to modify the `old_string` variable so that it is now `"LOOC SI YBUR"` and assign this to another variable called `new_string`. Keep the `old_string` assigned to `"Ruby is cool"`
