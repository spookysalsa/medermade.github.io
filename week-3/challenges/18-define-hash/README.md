Define a `Hash` variable called `my_info` which has the following keys:

* `:first_name`
* `:last_name`
* `:hometown`
* `:age`

Use your own personal information to fill in the keys.  Make sure `:age` is a positive integer and the rest are non-empty `Strings`.

The `Hash` needs to be stored in the `my_info` variable.
