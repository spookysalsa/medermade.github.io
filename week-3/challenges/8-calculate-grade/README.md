# U1.W3: Calculate a Letter Grade

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables and methods
- Use conditional statements
- Apply basic Ruby methods to variables

## Summary
Create a method `get_grade` that accepts an average in the class and returns the letter grade as a `String`.

It should only return one of `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, etc.  Don't worry about `+` and `-` grades.

For example,

```ruby
get_grade(89) # => returns "B", *not* "B+"
get_grade(70) # => returns "C"
```

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
