# U1.W3: Find the Largest Integer in an Array

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods
- Use conditional statements

## Summary
Find the largest integer in an array

Write a method `largest_integer` which takes as its input an `Array` of integers and returns the largest integer in the `Array`.

For example:

```ruby
largest_integer([-10, 0, 10])    # => 10
largest_integer([-10, -20, -30]) # => -10
```

If the input `Array` is empty `largest_integer` should return `nil`.
