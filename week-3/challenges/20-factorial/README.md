Write a `factorial` method which takes as its input a non-negative integer and calculates the factorial of that number.

The factorial of a number is the product of all integers from `1` up to that number.  For example:

```ruby
factorial(5) == 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 == 120
```

The factorial of `0` is defined to be `1`.

See [the Wikipedia article on the factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) for more information.
