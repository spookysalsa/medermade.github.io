# U1.W3: Define a method that returns a formatted address

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Create a method called `make_address` that accepts parameters for the `street`, `city` , `state`, and `zip`  and returns a single address string.

For example if we call the method as follows:

```ruby
make_address("633 Folsom St.", "San Francisco", "CA", "94107")
```

The return value would be

```ruby
"You live at 633 Folsom St., in the beautiful city of San Francisco, CA. Your zip is 94107."
```

**Note**: the words your output that are not part of the method parameters must match exactly with the words in the output above.


## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
