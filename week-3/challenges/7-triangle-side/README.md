Write a method `valid_triangle?` which takes as its input three non-negative numbers.  It should return `true` if the three numbers could form the side lengths of a triangle and `false` otherwise.

The arguments don't correspond to specific sides.  Don't worry about handling negative inputs &mdash; garbage in, garbage out.

For example,

```ruby
valid_triangle?(0,0,0) # => false, because a triangle can't have 0-length sides

valid_triangle?(1,1,1) # => true, an equilateral triangle

valid_triangle?(3,4,5) # => true, a right triangle
valid_triangle?(4,3,5) # => true, the same right triangle
valid_triangle?(5,3,4) # => true, the same right triangle

valid_triangle?(10, 10, 100) #=> false, no such triangle exists
```
