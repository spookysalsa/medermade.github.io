# U1.W3: Print a Pretty Right Triangle

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Iterate over arrays
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
Write a method `print_triangle` which takes at its input an integer representing the number of rows to print, and prints out a right triangle consisting of `*` characters, one line per row.

For example, `print_triangle(5)` should print out:

```text
*
**
***
****
*****
```

And `print_triangle(2)` should print out:

```text
*
**
```

If we pass in `0` it should print nothing (not even an empty line).

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

Remember, type `rspec` followed by the spec file name (and make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
