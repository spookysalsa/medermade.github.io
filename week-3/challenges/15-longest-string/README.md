# U1.W3: Find the Longest String in an Array

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables and methods
- Define a method that accepts and uses arguments
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods
- Use conditional statements

## Summary
Write a method `longest_string` which takes as its input an `Array` of `Strings` and returns the longest `String` in the `Array`.

For example:

```ruby
# 'zzzzzzz' is 7 characters long
longest_string(['cat', 'zzzzzzz', 'apples'])  # => "zzzzzzz"
```

If the input `Array` is empty `longest_string` should return `nil`.
