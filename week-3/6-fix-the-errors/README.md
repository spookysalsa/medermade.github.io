# U1.W3: Error-driven challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Run ruby programs from the command line
- Analyze error messages to determine why they are happening

## Summary
You have probably already had your share of seeing error messages pop up in your console when you run your ruby programs, which can be very frustrating. If you've taken a look at the error messages that get returned, it can be difficult to get past the "gobbly-gook" to find out what the problem is. In this challenge, you will be encountering a lot of errors. The point is to learn how to read each error and fix it to move on.

## Releases

## Release 0: Run your [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) in the console using the ruby interpreter like this:

`ruby my_solution.rb`

You should see something like this:

`my_solution.rb:20: ...`

## Release 1: Encounter the Error

Read the error closely.

Answer each of the following questions for each error in your [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file as a comment.

- What is the name of the file with the error? (hint: it's the first thing in the error message)
- What is the line number where the error occurs? (hint: it's after the file name)
- What is the error message? (hint: it's after the line number)
- What is ruby telling you is causing the error? (hint: it's in between the answer to 3 and 5)
- What is the 'type' of the error? (hint: it's in parenthesis)

## Release 1: Comment the error
When you finish answering the questions, comment out the line with the error and run the file again.

## Release 2: Repeat
Repeat release 0 and 1 for each error until there are no more errors left!

## Release 3: Publish
When your file runs with no errors, commit your changes and push them to GitHub!
