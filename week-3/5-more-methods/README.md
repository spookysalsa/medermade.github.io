## Releases

## Release 0: Read ch.9: Writing Your Own Methods
So you already know a bit about methods. Here is a chance to cement your understanding.

If you want to work on Pine's challenges as a bonus, feel free to add a file and add your code in this directory.

## Release 1: Challenges
Complete the following challenges. Be sure to take advantage of pairing!

- [Pretty Triangle](../exercises/19-pretty-triangle)
- [Factorial](../exercises/20-factorial)
- [Add it up](../exercises/21-add-it-up)

## Release 2: Reflect
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.
