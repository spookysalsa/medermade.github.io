Welcome to Phase 0! Below you will find links to the curriculum for each week. Each week will be released on Monday and will be due on the following Sunday at 11:59pm.

Each week's curriculum will be posted the Friday before the week starts.

### [Week 1: Git, GitHub, and the Command Line](week-1/README.md)
### [Week 2: HTML and CSS](week-2/README.md)
<!-- ### [Week 3: Introduction to Ruby](week-3/README.md) -->

## Required Books
You will need to get four books for Phase 0 (and Dev Bootcamp). There are two others that may be useful to you. Some are available for free online, and others will need to be purchased. Please make it a priority to get these books early.

- *[Learn to Program, 2nd edition](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)* by Chris Pine. This is used in Week 3.  The link is for the first edition, to get the second, you can either purchase it or google "Learn to Program 2nd edition Chris Pine" and there will be links for free PDF versions.
- *[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black3/)* by David A. Black. This book will need to be purchased. We have a deal for a discount with the publisher [coupon code here](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/blob/master/week-3/11-BONUS-challenges/Well-Grounded-Rubyist.md), but Amazon may be cheaper and faster if you have Prime. You'll need this by Week 3. The second edition will be useful for longer, but the first edition is also acceptable.
- *[Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)](http://www.poodr.com/)* by Sandi Metz. This book needs to be purchased and will be used in Week 6.
- *[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)* by Marijn Haverbeke. This is available for free online and will be used in Week 7.

#### Optional
We've gotten great feedback from students about these books. Amazon sells these together in a package at a discount if you want to get both.

- *[HTML and CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/)* by John Duckett. This would be useful for Week 2.
- *[JavaScript and JQuery](http://javascriptbook.com/)* by John Duckett - Useful in Week 7 and 8.
