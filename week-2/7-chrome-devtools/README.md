# U1.W2: Chrome DevTools

## Learning Competencies
- Navigate and edit a website's HTML and CSS elements using the Chrome DevTools inspector
- Use Chrome DevTools to manipulate elements in the DOM

## Summary
In this challenge, you'll be diving into Chrome DevTools. Inside the DevTools inspector window is an inner world of data that is communicated between the browser and server. These tools are invaluable for you as a developer and getting comfortable with them will help optimize your HTML and CSS editing, JavaScript debugging, and overall site performance. For the purposes of this challenge, we'll focus primarily on real-time HTML and CSS positioning in this challenge.

## Release 0: Research the DOM
Read/Watch both of the following resources to get some background on the DOM (Document Object Model) before diving into the challenge.
- [Skillcrush's introduction to the DOM](http://skillcrush.com/2012/10/17/dom-document-object-model/)
- [Introduction to the DOM (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZcldkGlt8)

## Release 1: Chrome's DevTools
Use [Code School's DevTools course](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) to acquaint yourself with Chrome's DevTools. Complete the challenges at the end of each. You only need to focus on the HTML and CSS chapters, when they move on to JavaScript, you are done.
  - Chapter 1: "Elements" or "Getting Started and Basic DOM and Styles"
  - Chapter 2: "Sources" or "Advanced DOM and Styles"

## Release 2: Practice
In this challenge, you are going to use Dev Tools to get practice with CSS positioning. Positioning with CSS can be challenging, so it's nice to practice with Dev Tools. Take what you learned in the Chrome Dev Tools course especially the information about changing elements using CSS to manipulate the position of the elements. We've provided example screen shots to show what we are aiming for the page to look like, try to get your page to look the same.

Load the [css-positioning.html](css-positioning.html) in your browser and open the Dev Tools inspector, and play around with the boxes. How can you select and change them?

Then, complete each of the following exercises. You will need to take a screen shot of each to include in your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file.

NOTE: A lot of learning CSS is trial and error. That's OK. If you are afraid you got the boxes formatted properly but don't know how you did it, cross out any CSS you changed to see how it effects the boxes. Then, when you feel like you know how you did it, erase everything you did and do it again.

#### Exercises
- Change the background-color of the boxes. To do this, in the css section type "background-color". You'll then see a list of colors - select your favorite for each box! We picked three random colors.

- Put the boxes in a row. (You can have them line up at the top or bottom, it's up to you.)

- Make the boxes have equal distance between them.<br>

- Move all the boxes into one column.<br>

- Resize the boxes so they are 30% of their original size.<br>

- Move the static div to the bottom and give it an absolute position (no matter what, it should always be at the bottom of the page). Make the footer 100% the width of the screen.

- Now make the static div a header at the top of the page with a fixed position so it's always at the top of the browser window. Make the width 95% of the entire screen and center it.

- Move the relative div position to the right so it's like a right sidebar.

- Design your own configuration that uses margin, border, and padding. Explain the differences and how to use each to yourself.

Upload each of your images into the week-2 [imgs](../imgs) directory and display them inline.

## Release 3: Reflect

Go to your [Reflection file](my_reflection.md) to write your reflection - include answers to the questions in the file in addition to the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md).

## Release 4: Commit and Push
Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
