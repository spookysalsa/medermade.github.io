## 4. Beginning HTML Reflection

- What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?

ANSWER: I like the translation of text into images. I enjoy the structure control that html allows. It seems to only have a small amount of limitations. I don't understand why css can't be included within an html document. I can see the advantage of having css on a different file. But it seems it would be convinient to be able to write it as you write your html page as well. I don't, however, understand html5. That's just another animal. Especially since part of our reading on "Document Outlines" includes a paragraph that states...."Warning! The HTML5 document outline, in practical terms, is theoretical only..."

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

ANSWER:I looked into html vs. xhtml. I seem to like the freedom of xhtml. I like that there is a bit of room for error. html syntax seems to be more strict and specific. Easier to get lost in a rabbit hole looking for errors.

- Did you have any "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?

ANSWER: I didn't know before how a css document was linked to an html document. I looked it up and that was my "aha" moment. Not bad!

- Did you have any previous experience with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?

ANSWER: I had read an "learn html" book about 10 years ago. So it was half review and half "what?!!!". In reality, it wasn't too difficult. It's good that we have references to guide us, though. It would be tideous to have to go through codecademy everytime we needed to reference something.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list them.

ANSWER: I have an old "learn html" book that I read long ago. It seems to help to have a paper reference. I'm not sure how much of it is outdated though.
