# Week 2: HTML and CSS

<!-- Week 2's material is not ready yet! It will be modified and released by the Friday before week 2 begins. -->

It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase-0-unit-1 master repo to get the newly-released curriculum. Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up! Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) for fetching changes.

This week's material covers web design, HTML, and CSS. You'll even get to build your own website! This week will be challenging since you are working with two new technologies in combination with git and will probably require more of your time than week 1.

It's important to start recognizing when you are spending too much time on a challenge. The solo challenge this week will probably take a lot of time, so be sure to time-box on all your challenges to keep yourself on task and out of rabbit holes!

Please keep track of the time you are spending on the mandatory sections of the challenges for your final week submission form so we can assess the amount of work we are assigning.

If you want to request feedback from your peers, tweet on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU1W2**. Only other DBC students can see your repositories because they are private.

Please note, we put the blog challenges at the end of the week, but you can decide when to work on them. They may be helpful to do in the middle or when you're stuck in another challenge.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU1W2.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 1 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 1)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. You should also try to figure out a fix -- it will help your markdown skills!
