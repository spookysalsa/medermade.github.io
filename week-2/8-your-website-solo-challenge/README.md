# U1.W2: Your Website (Solo Challenge)

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 2.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/) for more details as to what this entails.

## Learning Competencies
- Use wireframes to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary

In this challenge, you will make your [USERNAME].github.io site using the principles of design, site map, wireframe, and HTML and CSS you've learned this far. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site.

Get creative. Have fun. But be conscious of time. This site will be a work in progress, so you should timebox how much time you want to spend on each part. You will be able to make improvements each week or unit if you dedicate the time to it. Make an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this version. Designing and building a site can take a **LONG TIME**, so just get your site "good enough" for your MVP. You can always make it better later!

Pomodoro is a common and effective timeboxing and productivity technique that we can use in this exercise. Basically you do 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break. You can use your own timer or this web application [moosti](http://www.moosti.com). Take a second and estimate how many units you want to work on each section, and see where you are by the end. Then you can decide if you want to continue adding more time. You will be improving your website as you go through the program. Don't burn out now!

## Releases

## Release 0: Reconsider your Wireframes
Reconsider the wireframes you created for your index.html and blog/index.html pages in [3-wireframing](../3-wireframing). Do you need to make any changes based on what you've learned so far? If so, make the changes and upload your new wireframes to this directory.

## Release 1: Design
Now is the time to consider the colors, fonts, icons/logos, images and overall look and feel of your site. You may want to use some of the following resources:

- [Adobe Color CC](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to create a color theme for your site
- [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) to consider fonts

You also may want to complete the bonus challenge, [Make a Mood Board](../13-BONUS-challenges/mood-board), to help you solidify your design.

Again, don't get bogged down in your research trying to make your site perfect. Make it acceptable. You should make it a goal to revisit your site each week to add to it.

## Release 2: Development

#### Add Content using HTML
Using your wireframes and design ideas as references, add content to your index.html page in your [USERNAME].github.io site using HTML. You may want to focus on using HTML5 semantic elements instead of `<div>`s. Take a moment to look through the [HTML5 Document Outlines](http://html5doctor.com/outlines/). You can also use the [HTML5 Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) on w3schools.

Once you have all of the content on your index, make sure your HTML passes validation by running it in through a [validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). When it passes validation, you are ready to create your blog/index.html file. Be sure to add links to your week 1 blog posts! Be sure this HTML passes validation as well.

Remember, your website is a work in progress. Do not deviate from your wireframes until you've built your MVP. As we often say at DBC, "Done is better than perfect."

#### Apply CSS
Now you can truly begin to appreciate CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Each page can have a similar look if you use the same classes to format them.

In your stylesheets directory, add a `default.css` sheet. Using [this document](http://www.basictips.com/using-multiple-external-style-sheets.shtml) as a reference, add the default.css stylesheet to your blog-template.html (and week 1 blogs) so the default.css will be the first stylesheet referenced and will be supplemented by your `blog-stylesheet.css`

In your `default.css` stylesheet:
- Add styling to your header and footer
- Style and position the content to match your wireframes
- Incorporate the colors and fonts you want on your site
- Format any images you've selected

In your `blog-stylesheet.css` file:
- Add any CSS to personalize your blog posts

Don't forget about Chrome Devtools for testing out your style changes and figuring out if you are selecting elements properly.

REMINDER: Are you being true to your MVP or are you working on new features? Don't deviate from your original wireframes until AFTER you've built your MVP.

## Release 3: More Pages! (OPTIONAL)
If you want to add more to your site, consider adding a sections for:

- Projects
- About me (or Contact)
- Anything else you want to share

## Release 4: Publish
When you feel ready to publish your new site, add your files to the stage, commit your changes, and push to master. Post your site on Twitter using **#DBCmysite** to ask for feedback from your peers.

## Release 5: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Release 6: Review (optional)
Check out your peers websites and leave comments as issues. Search for them using the **#DBCmysite** hashtag!
