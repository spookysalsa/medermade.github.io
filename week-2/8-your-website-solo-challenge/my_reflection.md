Discuss the following:


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

ANSWER: I created the wireframe in the wireframe challenge. I stuck with the original design. I used mostly css to style the site.
With html, I created the basic information.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

ANSWER: I would like to stream line it so it looks a bit more sophisticated. Not entirely sure what that entails but
I'll figure it out.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

ANSWER: Nothing was too terribly difficult. I still have questions on how to use positioning. But I did enough trial and error testing to understand it enough.

* Create a TODO list of features you want to add in the future.

ANSWER: I'd like to add:
        - an auto date and time box.
        - video screen.
        - animation.
        - maybe a game.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

ANSWER: I used w3schools information mostly. I found it easy to follow and apply.
