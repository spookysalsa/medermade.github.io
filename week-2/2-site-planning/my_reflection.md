4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

ANSWER: I intend on having my site be simple yet elegant to show my proficiency in web design. Since this site will be geared toward future potential employers, I intend on having a working timeline of my progress at DBC. But, I will highlight my final strengths.

### Site map

Your site map:

- What did you learn about design and user experience?

ANSWER: There was so much to read about it. The last and second to last articles were lengthy. The last was confusing, as it had lots of tech lingo I didn't understand. That being said, I learned that if I do the same thing on my site, I may lose my audience quickly. So keeping it simple and clear is, in my opinion...key!

- Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun planning your site and creating a site map? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

ANSWER: It was frustrating at first in that I wasn't sure what pages to have and where content should go. Having a pre-made format could have helped but I understand that it's not as creative.

- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

ANSWER: How should I place everything on my pages? What content should I have? Am I doing it wrong? right? I used the resources given on this release. But I read every word of it.

- What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

ANSWER: I haven't gotten there yet, but I don't understand the use of png's, jpeg's, etc. in regards to adjusting their values to have a better functioning site.

- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

ANSWER: I feel confident that I will progress in my knowledge of all this and it'll become easier to understand.

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

ANSWER: The wire framing part was fun.

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

ANSWER: The reading was a bit dry and made what I thought was something visually creative into something scientific.
