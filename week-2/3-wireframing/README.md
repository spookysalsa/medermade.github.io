# U1.W2: Wireframing

## Learning Competencies
- Explain wireframing
- Identify the benefits of wireframing
- Wireframe a website

## Summary

One of the first steps in creating a web page is to wireframe it. This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.

In this challenge, you'll wireframe how you want your site to look.

While this sounds like it's only a personal challenge, you can pair on building a wireframe, and both use the same wireframe for your respective sites. Or you can both build different wireframes together and discuss the pros and cons of each wireframe. It would be useful to complete the reading prior to pairing.

It's easy to go down a rabbit hole while wireframing, so keep it simple and timebox yourself. A Wireframe doesn't have to be perfectly neat. Try to timebox the time you spend wireframing to one hour maximum.

## Releases

## Release 0: Intro to Wireframing

- Read: [A Beginners Guide to Wireframing](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399)
- Read: [Beyond Wireframing: Real Life UX Design Process](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/29/beyond-wireframing-real-life-ux-design-process/)


## Release 1: Wireframe your site's index
The index is the homepage of your site. It's the page you will land on if you type in [USERNAME].github.io into the browser so it's important it makes a good first impression. Consider how you want the index to look. You will be using this site to promote yourself when you finish Dev Bootcamp, so at the very least, you should have a header, footer, and navigation bar. You'll probably also want to include places for the following:

  - Links to your social networks (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Quora, GitHub etc.)
  - Your picture
  - Your contact information
  - Link to your blog
  - About me
  - Your projects
  - Anything else you want to include

You can choose to use a [wireframing tool](http://mashable.com/2010/07/15/wireframing-tools/) or draw it on paper and take a picture of it. Make sure to save an image of your wireframe and name it "wireframe-index." (it can be saved as png, jpg, etc.) If you drew it on paper, take a picture and upload it to this directory (week-2/3-wireframing)! Remember, wireframes don't need to be beautiful, they can be very simple as long as they get the idea of what you want your site to look like.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Don't worry about actually creating any of these pages using HTML yet. You'll do that in your solo challenge.

## Release 2: Wireframe your blog/index.html Template

When people navigate to your blog from the main index of your [USERNAME].github.io site, you will want them to see a list of your blog posts.

Wireframe the way you want this landing page to look. Keep in mind, you will have 16 blog posts when you finish Phase 0, so you may want to think about how you want to display your links.

When you finish your wireframe, name it "wireframe-blog-index" and upload it to this directory as well.

## Release 3: Display your wireframes

Now that you have your wireframes designed and a digital image of each saved in this directory, you'll want to display them in your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file. Use the instructions for adding an image from [2-site-planning](../2-site-planning) to add both images to your site.

## Release 4: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, navigate to the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge and answer the questions by editing the file. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
